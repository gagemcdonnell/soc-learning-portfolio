## Types of Personal Data

-### Volunteered data - Agreeing to share/store data. Ex. Social media
-### Inferred data - Data generated by activities. Ex. Credit score
-### Observed data - Data captured by recording the actions of an individual. Ex. Location data

## Common Methods of Data Transmission

Electrical signals - Transmission achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
Optical signals - Transmission achieved by converting electrical signals into light pulses.
Wireless signals - Transmission achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

## Bandwidth
- The capacity of a medium to carry data. Measured in the number of bits that can be sent across the media in a second.
  
## Can be measured in:
- Bits per second (bps)         # fundamental unit of bandwidth
- Kilobits per second (kbps)    # 1,000 bps
- Megabits per second (mbps)    # 1,000,000 bps
- Gigabits per second (gbps)    # 1,000,000,000 bps
- Terabits per second (tbps)    # 1,000,000,000,000 bps

## Throughput 
- The actual rate of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.
  
## Influenced by factors:
- Amount of data being sent and received over the connection.
- The type of data being transmitted.
- The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination.
  
### Throughput measurements do not take into account the validity or usefulness of the bits being transmitted and received.

## SOC Relevance
- Understanding bandwidth and throughput helps understand network congestion.
- Understanding how data is transmitted helps interpret network logs and traffic behavior.
- Recognizing types of personal data is important for identifying data exposure risks.
- Latency can indicate routing anomalies or suspicious traffic patterns.
