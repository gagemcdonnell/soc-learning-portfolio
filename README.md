# SOC Learning Portfolio

This repo documents my self-study progress while building foundational skills for SOC & blue team cybersecurity roles. 

My main focus:
- Security fundamentals and terminology
- Networking (IP, DNS, ports, protocols)
- Linux fundamentals (WSL/Ubuntu)
- Python scripting for automation + file handling
- Documenting my workflows in a manner that will prepare me for an SOC role

My goal is to have a foundational understanding of the above focuses to prepare me for my CompTIA Security+ exam that I will be taking in Summer 2026.

## What's Inside This Repo
- **/notes** - Weekly learning notes (Python, Linux, Networking)
- **/scripts** - Python Scripts for automation and log/file handling
- **/writeups** - Lab writeups (TryHackMe, exercises, investigations)

## Current Progress
- Learning Python fundamentals (file handling, loops, functions)
- Practicing Linux commands in WSL
- Studying networking basics (ports, protocols, DNS)
- Beginning SOC-style documentation habits

This repo will continue to grow as I build hands-on skills through scripting, labs, and security-focused exercises.
