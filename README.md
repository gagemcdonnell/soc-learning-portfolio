# SOC Learning Portfolio

This repo documents my self-study progress while building foundational skills for SOC & blue team cybersecurity roles. 

My main focus:
- Security fundamentals and terminology
- Networking (IP, DNS, ports, protocols)
- Linux fundamentals (WSL/Ubuntu)
- Python scripting for automation + file handling
- Documenting my workflows in a manner that will prepare me for an SOC role

My goal is to have a foundational understanding of the above focuses to prepare me for my CompTIA Security+ exam that I will be taking in Summer 2026.

I have notes files containing weekly notes for each of my focuses (Python notes + eventually scripts, Linux basics + commands, networking basics). 

I will be adding Python scripts and labs as I progress and gain a better understanding of these topics.
