# SOC Learning Portfolio

This repo documents my self-study progress while building foundational skills for SOC & blue team cybersecurity roles.

My main focus:
- Security fundamentals
- Networking (IP, DNS, ports, protocols)
- Linux fundamentals (WSL/Ubuntu)
- Python scripting for automation + log parsing
- SOC-style investigation workflows and documentation
